# Hacking Equity: Ideas for a More Equitable Recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic
> PaTH RAND+TNL hackathon event prep

## Context
One way to think about the health of a society is in terms of the well-being of its most vulnerable and disadvantaged members. Do they have access to the services they need? To transportation? Are their neighborhoods safe? Do their jobs pay them enough to support themselves and their families? Are their rights protected?  From the earliest days, it was clear that the COVID-19 pandemic was making inequities worse, but the full impact of the pandemic on our vulnerable communities is still coming into focus. The first step to effective policy analysis is seeing a problem as clearly as the data will allow. The aim of this hackathon is to help us see more clearly.

The guiding question for this hackathon is: **Can we paint data-driven pictures of how our vulnerable populations fared throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and the extent to which government policies (or lack thereof) have either increased or decreased inequities?**  

The goal is to apply your skills, ingenuity, and lived experiences to expose the inequitable outcomes and effects of the pandemic, as well as the effects of our policy responses to date. We encourage you to try as much as possible to “center” the needs of vulnerable populations and incorporate social justice considerations in your explorations. To aid you in this exercise, we will provide data sets that highlight different aspects of the U.S. response to the pandemic, along with demographic data to help identify key sub-demographics.
