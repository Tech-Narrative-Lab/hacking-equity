This data was calculated using the formula found on this page: https://www.ed-data.org/article/Ethnic-Diversity-Index

The calculation assumed the following 8 racial groups:
1. American Indian and Alaska Native alone
2. Asian alone
3. Black or African American alone
4. Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone
5. Some Other Race alone
6. White alone
7. Population of two races
8. Population of three or more races

#Note - the eighth category of Population of three or more races was derived by subtracting the group "population of two races"
from the group "population of two or more races" in the Census State Data with Overlays
